# RadialRangeSelector
A flexible SwiftUI radial range selector inspired by neumorphic laser animations. Using it is as easy as typing out:             "RadialRangeSelector(minUser: $min, maxUser: $max, minVal: -100, maxVal: 100, increment: 10, radius: 125, color: Color.red, dotted: true)"

I developed this for my mental math practice app, "CountQuick!"

This range selector supports custom integer specifications, increments, sizes, colors, and two styles (dotted vs line). There's also space to add your own button in the middle of it, if you choose to.
